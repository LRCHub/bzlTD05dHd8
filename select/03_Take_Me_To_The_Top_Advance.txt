we can talk about it, what's been done is gone
what's the use in doubting, when we've both been wrong
spending all my time with, you've gonna sigh
feel so lonely, you got to act tonight

loving, modern lover
keep on trying, don't you ever give up
above seasons, keep on tryin'
let's take it higher, feeling from the top
we don' t need pretending, whether it's for real
try to justify mean, try not to feel

don't wanna stop, with no protection
take me to the top, let's make connection
don't wanna stop, sweet perfection
take me to the top, take me to the top!
I don't will get over, and that will is strong
If I didn' t had it, then I go wrong
there's no waste of time with, explain you why
bring together, we can make up trough the night

loving, modern lover
keep on trying, dont you ever give up
and above season, keep on trying
let's take it higher, feeling from the top
knowing one another, we don't have to deal
then I like the other, try not to feel
knowing what astounding, feeling what I feel
don't know why I talk to you, try not to feel

don't wanna stop, don't stop reflecting
take me to the top, let's make connection
don't wanna stop, make it perfection
take me to the top, hold me protection
don't wanna stop, within perfection
take me to the top, go on connection
don't wanna stop, this is perfection
take le to the top. only perfection.
